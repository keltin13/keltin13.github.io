I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist at the Software Engineering Institute's AI Division, working on applied research projects to help create robust, secure, and scalable mission-driven AI/ML systems. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a major in Statistics and Machine Learning, and an additional major in Computer Science. I love all things data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I've been in to triathlons the past couple years (I raced a half-Ironman!), and I also like playing chess, skiing, philosophy, and playing soccer, but itâ€™s hard to pin me down to just one thing!
