This page contains a selection of data analysis reports that I have written for a variety of classes during my time at CMU.

Below is a document analyzing changes in the usage of Boston's bike-sharing network before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. This was a group
project for my Statistical Visualization course where we showed off a variety of plots for a variety of different data types.

The rest of the documents are reports from a two-course series on the statistical theory of linear regression and other fundamental
statistics concepts.
