ad_description: My month-long internship at a South Korean university.
---

From June 26 to July 27, 2018, I interned at the South Korean university Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology Department of Energy Science and Engineering under Professor Su-Il In. I assisted graduate students Saurav Sorcar and Ali Shahzad in their effort to develop a material that uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuel at industrial efficiencies.

In a break from my previous experience, I worked in the lab every day, setting up photocatalytic experiments and sythesizing samples. I was able to put my data science skills to use, however, as I wrote an R script to calculate and plot incremental efficiencies and derivitaves of the sample output, data that was an integral part of the paper that I co-authored on the subject.

The paper below discusses the results of our reduced blue-titania photocatalyst, sensitized with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles, and its world-class sustained and peak efficiencies.
