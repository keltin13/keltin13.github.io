15-112, or Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, is Carnegie Mellon University's main introductory computer science
course. For the final three weeks of class, the students are tasked with creating a term project that is complex and interactive,
the rest is up to them. My project was named Salvation:

Salvation is a pseudo-3D first person shooter where you must battle through monster-filled levels to escape, picking up valuable
items along the way. There are three modes: Campaign, with three pre-made levels; Random, where a map is randomly generated;
and the Level Editor, where players can construct their own maps. The method used to create the 3D view is called raycasting,
which I learned about from <a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Out of more than 450 students, I was one of 12 selected to present my project in front of the rest of the class. A short video
I made about my project can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/T4oPAS3Nhwo" target="_blank">here</a> and a gallery of the
whole class's projects is <a href="http://www.kosbie.net/cmu/fall-19/15-112/gallery.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
